# GitHub-Servers-DNS-Servers.
This project was implemented using cisco packet tracer.

GitHub servers manage code repositories, enabling version control and collaboration for developers, while DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses, facilitating web navigation. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, we can simulate and configure these servers by setting up a network topology with routers, switches, PCs, and servers, configuring network settings, and verifying connectivity and service functionality. This allows for practical understanding and visualization of network configurations and server management.
